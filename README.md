# PAMPHLET

TOCQ.IO is a community based messaging service with publishing functionality that uses cryptographic approaches to only encrypt and decrypt data on the device where it is created or viewed. Certificates for  signing, encryption and decryption will only be issued based on [Hardware-backed Keystore](https://source.android.com/security/keystore) or [Secure Enclave](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/secure-enclave-sec59b0b31ff/web). In the future other certification means might be supported.

It will be possible to use TOCQ.IO anonymously by installing it on a supported device. Anonymous users can use aliases to become discoverable. If users want to identify themselves to support transparency and openness, they can use an official identification document to register.

TOCQ.IO is owned by its users through a cooperative registered under TOCQ.COOP. Each identified user becomes a member of the cooperative and thus has the right to vote on the direction and future of the organisation.

An identified user will bring their data and own their data within the organisation. All data be it personal data, personally created data or anonymously created can be share with either no other users, specific other users are all users, including the general public. It will not be necessary to create an account to consume openly published data within the TOCQ.IO app or website.

The domains TOCQ.IO and TOCQ.COOP are owned by a foundation under the domain TOCQ.ORG. The foundation has 9 members and owns the domains TOCQ.IO, TOCQ.ORG and TOCQ.COOP. The foundation is the last resort in case a hostile group is trying to gain the majority on TOCQ.IO and steers it away from its foundational principles of kindness, transparency, openness and right for anonymity. The 9 members of the foundation will be assigned based on a defined selection criteria to guarantee diversity of thought. Each member has to be confirmed by the community with at least x% amount of votes. The foundation also owns the right to publish all source code and artefacts representing the digital backbone of the community. It has the obligation to release the app and run the public website.

Any creation, publishing, sharing, or other supported actions within the TOCQ.IO community are stored fully anonymised on a ledger shared by TOCQ.ORG. The ledger will be open and will contain all actions happening within the TOCQ.IO community.

Content moderation will happen:
* Content is reviewed for its legal compliance to European standards before it is publish to the general public. Illegal content will be handed over to the authorities.
* Public content can be flagged by any identified or anonymous member of the community as not appropriate within the standards of the community. A specific number of members will be randomly selected and have to vote on the publishing of such content. If more than 1/3 will vote against it, the content will be unpublished and archived.
* Content shared within a specific closed group will be deleted if one member of that group feels the content to be inappropriate.
* If a member of a closed group becomes uncomfortable with the direction of the group they can anonymously report the group to the community for a review.
* An external user can ask a closed group to disclose their content to the community for review.

Content that can be shared are:
- Text messages, may contain mark-up.
- Video messages
- Audio messages
Each message can have a maximum size of 10MB and can reference other messages or external content over links.

Messages are shared under the subdomain of that specific member or even under their own domain registered with TOCQ.IO.

It is possible for legal and private persons to become members of the community. A legal person has one voting right per legal person, similar to private persons who have also one voting right. Private persons who associate themselves with a legal person cannot vote in addition to the legal persons voting right.

Legal person who want to publish content will have to pay a fee for each published item of content. Fees will be used to pay TOCQ.ORG for running the community. Any surplus will be payed out equally to all private members of the community on a yearly basis. Once a year the fees for legal persons will be set by voting on them across the community.

Private persons of the community who want to receive personalised content from private or legal persons can publish those anonymised parts of their profile that can be used to personalise such content. Personalisation can include localisation, age specific offerings or any other personalisation vector. Users who are interested in personalised content will not have more or less rights than users who are not interested.

Private or legal persons who want to target specific audiences within the cohort of users can do so and select from a set of personalisation parameters.

Any content will anyway always be randomly displayed based on its publishing date.
